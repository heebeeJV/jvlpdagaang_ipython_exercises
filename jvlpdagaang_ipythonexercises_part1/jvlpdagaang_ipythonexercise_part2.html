			<h3>IPython Exercise Part 2</h3>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>1.</h4>
			    2.4.1
		    </div>
			
		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>2.</h4>
			 	IPython give a more comprehensible output since it display the keys along with the random value generated while the typical python gave the keys with memory addresses as pointers to the random value in memory
		    </div>

		     <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>3.</h4>
			    IPython gave possible methods that can be used for the list b
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>4.</h4>
			    all the callables (methods, constants, etc.) the can be used inside the module numpy
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>5.</h4>
			    gives the description and type of the b (type, string form, length, etc.)
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>6.</h4>
			    the single question mark gives the function description (type, string form, etc.) while the double question mark gives the function description and the whole source of the function
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>7.</h4>
			    ???
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>8.</h4>
			    inside the IPython shell, cd inside file folder then input: run <script_name.py> 
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>9.</h4>
			    after running the script, the shell gave no output but when the input result was inputted, the result of the computation given the value inside script was given as an output. In IPython, every "global" data declarations including the methods inside the script can be accessed and used independtly, this cannot by done in the regular python shell.
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>10.</h4>
			   	putting the -i option after the run command (before the script file) give the script the ability to use namespaces currently isnide the shell
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
			    <h4>11.</h4>
			   	IPython automatically generates new lines to compensate for the number of lines the copied code and runs the pasted code as soon as the enter key is pressed.
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>12.</h4>
		    	IPython has a magic command %paste that you put in inside the IPython shell which automatically puts in the clipboard code into its shell as a source and not per line and automatically runs the code.
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>13.</h4>
		    	using the %cpaste method, Ipython can continuously past in code before running. Ending pasting can be done in two ways either by pressing "ctrl+D" or typing two dashes on an empty line and pressing enter
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>14.</h4>
		    	???
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>15.</h4>
		    	The addtional information provided inside the stack trace are the the complete information regarding where the exception occured and which line, triggered by what and raised what.
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>16.</h4>
		    	adding -d after the %run function
		    </div>

		    <div class="aalert alert-success">
		    	<h4>17.</h4>
		    	???
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>18.</h4>
		    	cpu time
		    </div>


		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>19.</h4>
		    	Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])? y

		    	removed all records of namespaces previous present inside the shell
		    </div>

		    <div class="alert alert-success">
		    	<h4>20.</h4>
		    	automagic removed the necessity of puthong "%" before the command, example, the "%run" command can be just "run"
